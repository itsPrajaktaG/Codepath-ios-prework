App Idea I would like to build:
I want to build an app that helps minors track their driving hours for behind the wheel program to ensure safer drivers. the following app wouldtrack how long the student drove for, where they drove, as well as keep track of the locations driven. Similar ot google maps it will display the speed limit to help student stay on track with road safety guidelines.
